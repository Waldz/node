Terms & Conditions of Mysterium Platform and Mysterion Software for Nodes


Mysterium open source software platform (“Mysterium Platform”)  is a software that enables you (the “Node”) to contribute to Mysterium network by providing to its users (the “Customers”) a possibility to use your internet connection and your technical resources for their private browsing.

The Mysterium Platform rests on open-source software. This is an experimental version of the Mysterium Platform, and there is a risk that the NetSys Inc. (“Network Operator”) or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Network Operator, might unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Mysterium Platform or Software causing the system to lose cryptocurrency stored in one or more Client accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens issued on the Mysterium Platform, or causing to suffer other losses, inconvenience, or damage to its users. The user expressly knows and agrees that the user is using the Mysterium Platform and Mysterion software at the user’s sole risk.

Mysterium Platform is run and maintained by NetSys Inc. (the “Network Operator”). These Terms and Conditions (“T&C”) constitute an agreement between you and Network Operator and govern your access and use of Mysterium Platform and contribution to private browsing services (the “Services”).
